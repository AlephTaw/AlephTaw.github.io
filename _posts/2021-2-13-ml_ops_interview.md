# The ML-Ops Interview Guide



## Definition of MLOps:

Definition: Machine learning operations (machine learning operations management) is a dicipline concerned with the design, construction and management  of reproducible, testable, and evolvable ML-powered software.

## Goals of MLOps:

1. Unify the release cycle for machine learning and software applications.
2. Enable automated testing of machine learning artifacts (e.g. data validation, ML model testing, and ML model integration testing)
3. Apply agile principles to machine learning projects.
4. Integrate machine learning models and datasets into CI/CD systems
5. Reduce technical debt across machine learning models.
6. Do so in a principled manner that is language, framework, platform, and infrastructure agnostic.

## Motivation for ML Ops:

1. Deployment Gap
2. Scenarios Necessitating Management
