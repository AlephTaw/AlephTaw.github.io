## Welcome to the Open Boot Camp!

This is where I document helpful resources and projects that I have found or created on the path to independent mastery in Full-Stack Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning Operation, and more. 

While there are many projects associated with this blog, the primary indexing repository is here: [the-open-data-science-bootcamp](https://github.com/AlephTaw/the-open-data-science-bootcamp)

I hope you find these resources helpful on your journey towards technical mastery!
